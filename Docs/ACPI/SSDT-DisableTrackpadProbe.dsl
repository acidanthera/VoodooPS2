// For computers that either have no trackpad (eg. desktop with PS2 mouse)
// or laptops without any support by VoodooPS2Trackpad.kext, you can disable
// each of the trackpad drivers, such that they don't probe.
//
// This can improve the reliability of VoodooPS2Mouse.kext and is more efficient as well.
